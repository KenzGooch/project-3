        <h3>ENGINE</h3><br>
        <p>Handcrafted 4.0L V-8 engines deliver massive thrust with compact benefits in weight and efficiency. <br>
        Twin turbos mounted inside the “V” force-feed massive boost to each Direct Injected cylinder, and <br>
        express-deliver 100 km/h in 3.8 seconds for the 503-hp AMG GT S, and just 4.0 seconds for the 456-hp AMG GT. <br>
        Both engines unleash a high, broad plateau of torque, along with a growling exhaust note you can revel in or reel in, as you wish.</p>

        <h3>BRAKES</h3><br>
      <p>The AMG GT features large 360mm perforated and ventilated discs at all four wheels, with 6-piston <br>
      front calipers. Enormous 390mm compound front brake discs are grasped by red-painted calipers on the AMG GT S. <br>
      Available AMG Carbon Ceramic brakes combine 40% lighter weight with larger 402mm two-piece front discs and <br>
      bronze-painted calipers. The harder, longer-wearing carbon-fibre-reinforced ceramic discs offer even shorter <br>
      stopping distances and higher fade-resistance in high-performance driving.</p>

        <h3>COCKPIT</h3><br>
      <p>The Mercedes-AMG GT cockpit envelops your body, heightens your senses, and connects with your driving instincts.<br>
         The dramatically wide console and crisp instruments are inspired by the precision of aviation. The thick steering <br>
         wheel and intuitive controls put you in command and at ease. Deeply contoured AMG Performance seats support your <br>
         every move, while a standard fixed-glass Panoramic roof enhances your outlook.</p>

      <section id="wheels" class="content-box">
        <img src="img/wheels.jpg"/>
        <h3>WHEELS</h3><br>
      <p>Every Mercedes-AMG GT grips the road via high-performance tires and precision-crafted wheels that are staggered in <br>
        width and diameter. The 19" front and 19" or 20" rear wheels (AMG GT S) are sized to optimize power delivery and steering feel. <br>
        Six choices per model include cast- or forged-alloy construction and three finishes, from shimmering silver to menacing matte black.</p>

      <section id="frame" class="content-box">
        <img src="img/frame.jpg"/>
        <h3>FRAME</h3><br>
      <p>Crafted almost entirely from aluminum, the core of the AMG GT’s impeccable performance is its high-strength spaceframe. <br>
        Cast, extruded and stamped aluminum composes 90% of its body, with magnesium and advanced polymers among the remainder.<br>
         Weighing a mere 235 kg, the spaceframe delivers class-leading torsional and longitudinal rigidity.</p>

        <img src="img/lights.jpg"/>
        <h3>LIGHTS</h3><br>
      <p>Approximating daylight even more closely than xenon headlamps, the standard full-LED headlamps enhance your nighttime <br>
        vision, adapting to the road and traffic ahead by automatically shining as far as possible. Distinctive LED Daytime Running <br>
        Lamps and LED taillamps combine eye-opening brilliance with eye-catching style.</p>
