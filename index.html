        <h3>ENGINE</h3><br>
        <p>Handcrafted 4.0L V-8 engines deliver massive thrust with compact benefits in <br>
        weight and efficiency. Twin turbos mounted inside the “V” force-feed massive <br>
        boost to each Direct Injected cylinder, and express-deliver 100 km/h in 3.8 <br>
        seconds for the 503-hp AMG GT S, and just 4.0 seconds for the 456-hp AMG GT. <br>
        Both engines unleash a high, broad plateau of torque, along with a growling <br>
        exhaust note you can revel in or reel in, as you wish.</p>

        <h3>BRAKES</h3><br>
      <p>The AMG GT features large 360mm perforated and ventilated discs at all four <br>
        wheels, with 6-piston front calipers. Enormous 390mm compound front brake discs <br>
        are grasped by red-painted calipers on the AMG GT S. Available AMG Carbon Ceramic <br>
        brakes combine 40% lighter weight with larger 402mm two-piece front discs and <br>
      bronze-painted calipers. The harder, longer-wearing carbon-fibre-reinforced ceramic <br>
      discs offer even shorter stopping distances and higher fade-resistance in <br>
      high-performance driving.</p>

        <h3>COCKPIT</h3><br>
      <p>The Mercedes-AMG GT cockpit envelops your body, heightens your senses, and <br>
        connects with your driving instincts. The dramatically wide console and crisp <br>
        instruments are inspired by the precision of aviation. The thick steering wheel and <br>
        intuitive controls put you in command and at ease. Deeply contoured AMG Performance <br>
        seats support your every move, while a standard fixed-glass Panoramic roof enhances your outlook.</p>

      <section id="wheels" class="content-box">
        <img src="img/wheels.jpg"/>
        <h3>WHEELS</h3><br>
      <p>Every Mercedes-AMG GT grips the road via high-performance tires and precision-crafted <br>
        wheels that are staggered in width and diameter. The 19" front and 19" or 20" rear <br>
        wheels (AMG GT S) are sized to optimize power delivery and steering feel. Six choices <br>
        per model include cast- or forged-alloy construction and three finishes, from <br>
        shimmering silver to menacing matte black.</p>

      <section id="frame" class="content-box">
        <img src="img/frame.jpg"/>
        <h3>FRAME</h3><br>
      <p>Crafted almost entirely from aluminum, the core of the AMG GT’s impeccable performance<br>
         is its high-strength spaceframe. Cast, extruded and stamped aluminum composes 90% of <br>
         its body, with magnesium and advanced polymers among the remainder. Weighing a mere <br>
         235 kg, the spaceframe delivers class-leading torsional and longitudinal rigidity.</p>

        <img src="img/lights.jpg"/>
        <h3>LIGHTS</h3><br>
      <p>Approximating daylight even more closely than xenon headlamps, the standard full-LED <br>
        headlamps enhance your nighttime vision, adapting to the road and traffic ahead by <br>
        automatically shining as far as possible. Distinctive LED Daytime Running <br>
        Lamps and LED taillamps combine eye-opening brilliance with eye-catching style.</p>
